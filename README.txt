Portfolio

A portfolio to display my applications and background!
Modifying a template provided by @ajlkn, the page uses HTML, JS, and SASS to provide visualizations and allow user interactions. 

The page links back to my github, and connects to varying applications that have been launched. 
This allows a glimps at my accomplishments and skill, as well a providing a more personable short bio at the end. 

Check it out!
